[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These tools are obsolete and unportable.  The command syntax is poorly defined.  Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep commands instead.

       The default signal for skill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in three ways: -9 -SIGKILL -KILL.

       The default priority for snice is +4.  Priority numbers range from +20 (slowest) to -20 (fastest).  Negative priority numbers are restricted to administrative users.
